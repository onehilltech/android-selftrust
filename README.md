A simple library for supporting self-signed certificates in Java

* Integrate with services that use **self-signed certificates**: 
* **Preserve** existing security measures on the mobile device
* Ideal for **prototyping and testing** using secure protocols.

**NOTE.** We strongly recommend that you purchase a certificate from a trusted authority 
when you move to production.

## Installation

#### Gradle

```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}

dependencies {
  compile com.github.onehilltech.selfsigned:core:x.y.z
  
  // Using Android Volley
  compile com.github.onehilltech.selfsigned:volley:x.y.z
}
```

## Getting Started

Manually define the list of hostnames/IP addresses that are using self-signed 
certificates. It is best to define the list as a resource so you can have
different list for different Gradle configurations:

```xml
<resources>
    <string-array name="hostnames">
        <!-- localhost on the Android emulator -->
        <item>10.0.2.2</item>
    </string-array>
</resources>
```

Define an `Application` class to initialize the `HostnameVerifier` for
the `HttpsURLConnection`.

```java
public class TheApplication extends Application 
{
  /// Collection of HostnameVerifier objects, such as the default one 
  private final HostnameVerifiers verifiers_ = new HostnameVerifiers ();
  
  /// Simple verifier that uses a set of hostnames/IP addresses.
  private final SimpleHostnameVerifier simpleHostnameVerifier_ = new SimpleHostnameVerifier ();

  @Override
  public void onCreate ()
  {
    super.onCreate ();

    // Get default verifier. Use it and the simple one.
    HostnameVerifier defaultHostnameVerifier = HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier ();

    if (!(defaultHostnameVerifier instanceof HostnameVerifiers))
      this.initHostnameVerifiers ();

    // Load the hostnames, and add to the simple verifier.
    String [] hostnames = this.getResources ().getStringArray (R.array.hostnames);
    this.simpleHostnameVerifier_.addAll (Arrays.asList (hostnames));
  }

  private void initHostnameVerifiers ()
  {
    this.verifiers_.add (HttpsURLConnection.getDefaultHostnameVerifier ());
    this.verifiers_.add (this.simpleHostnameVerifier_);

    HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier (this.verifiers_);
  }
}
```

Make sure you add the `Application` class to `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<application
    android:name="[package].TheApplication"
    
    >
    
</application>
```

Add the public certificate to the application's assets. For example, if
the certificate is in a file named `server.crt`, then it must be added
to `main/assets/server.crt` (or the assets folder for the target configuration).

### Android

* See [[android-selfsigned|https://github.com/onehilltech/android-selfsigned]]

Use `VolleySelfTrust` to create a `RequestQueue` that is configured to use the
public certificate bundled as an asset:

```
VolleySelfTrust.newRequestQueue (context, "server.crt")
```

Now, request executed on the returned `RequestQueue` that interact with an 
hostname/IP address defined in the resources above will not throw the usual 
security exceptions.
